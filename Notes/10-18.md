Big O

- There might be many approaches to solve a problem. Ho do you know which one is the best?
- You may think that your code works, why should I care about other stuff? 
- In Interviews or Large scale companies performance and best approached matter a lot.
- Big-O notation is the language to talk about how your code performs
    - It is useful discuss trade-offs between solutions (time vs space)
    - Identify inefficient parts of your code
- Example:
    - Sum upto n
Approach 1:
function sumUpto(n) {
	total = 0;
	for(i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
		total += i;
	}
	return total;
}

approach 2: 

function sumUpto(n) {
	return (n*(n+1))/2;
}

        - Which approach is better? How do we compare?
            - Faster?
            - Less memory?
            - More readable?

- Big O - Formal intro
    - Big O Notation is a way to formalize fuzzy counting
    - It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the inputs grows
